# readme for neural network for solving xor problem

- to compile: make
- to run: make run
- to clean: make clean

## Question1
   #### What is the minimum number of hidden layer nodes required for this multi-layered ANN to learn to solve the 3 parity XOR problem?
  - minimum number of hidden nodes = 1

## Question2
 #### Devise a list of training examples to teach the ANN to solve the 3 parity XOR problem. # How many training examples did it take for your ANN to correctly learn to solve the 3 # parity XOR problem?

 ### training examples
 - The program was run 50 000 times for each input so to train it to solver the xor problem
