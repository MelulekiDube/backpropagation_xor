## Question1
   #### What is the minimum number of hidden layer nodes required for this multi-layered ANN to learn to solve the 3 parity XOR problem?
  - minimum number = 1

## Question2
 #### Devise a list of training examples to teach the ANN to solve the 3 parity XOR problem. # How many training examples did it take for your ANN to correctly learn to solve the 3 # parity XOR problem?
